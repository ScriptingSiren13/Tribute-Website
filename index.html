                <p>Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist and former chairman of Tata Sons.
                    He was also the chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, serving also as interim chairman from
                    October 2016 through February 2017.

                    <br><br>


                    Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj, on 28 December 1937. He is the
                    son of Naval Tata, who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family, and Sooni Tata, the
                    niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata. Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, was a
                    member of the Tata family by blood. He continues to head its charitable trusts.

                    received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India,after receiving the
                    Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.</div>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> He graduated from the Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's
                    degree in architecture, and the Harvard Business School through a management course he completed in
                    1975. He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded
                    J. R. D. Tata's as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the
                    Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely
                    India-centric group into a global business. <strong>Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists
                        in the world, having donated around around 60-65% of his income to charity. </strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Tata is a supporter of education, medicine and rural development, and considered a leading
                    philanthropist in India. Tata supported University of New South Wales Faculty of
                    Engineering to develop capacitive deionization to provide improved water for challenged
                    areas.

                    Tata Hall at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), opened in November 2018,
                    houses facilities for the biological and physical sciences and is the home of the Tata Institute for
                    Genetics and Society. The Tata Institute for Genetics and Society is a bi-national institution that
                    coordinates research between UC San Diego and research operations in India to assist in societal and
                    infrastructure development in the area of combating vector-borne diseases. Tata Hall is named in
                    recognition of a generous $70 million gift from Tata Trusts.</p>
